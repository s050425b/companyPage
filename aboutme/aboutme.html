                    Henkel was founded in 1876. People around the world trust Henkel’s brands and technologies. 
                    In the fiscal year 2015, the company reported sales of approx. 
                    18 billion euros and an operating profit of 2.9 billion euros (adjusted for one-time gains/charges and restructuring charges). 
                    The DAX-30 company has its headquarters in Düsseldorf, Germany. 
                    Henkel employs about 50,000 people worldwide, more than 80 percent of whom work outside of Germany. 
                    Henkel is thus one of the most international German companies.

                     select regions. In 2015, the Laundry & Home Care business unit generated sales of 5,137 million euros, 28 percent of total company sales.
